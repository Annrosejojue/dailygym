This project is a Spring Boot backend that accepts CSV uploads and stores them locally.  
Each upload creates a job entry in PostgreSQL and returns a unique job_id.  
The system uses a clean API–Service–Persistence architecture.  
Week 1 includes file validation, storage, and job tracking.  
Future weeks add Python validation, anomaly detection, and full workflow automation.
